# Accord Project Template Studio (v2)

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/088bd784-321b-49d4-940b-8c1c0af6942f/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/accordproject-studio/deploys)
 
  [Go to Accord Project Template Studio](https://accordproject-studio.netlify.com/)
## Notes for development:

In order to link another React component to template-studio-v2 for development, following these steps:
1. Ensure template-studio-v2 is on your local machine.
2. Ensure your React component has been built - in its root directory, run `npm run build`.
3. In the root directory of your React component intended to link, run `npm link`.
4. Copy the `name` property of this React component from its `package.json` file.
5. In the root directory of template-studio-v2, run `npm link <INSERT NAME HERE>`.
6. Refresh and ensure the `<NAME>` is in the `node_modules` directory.
7. Run `npm run start`.

(Adding `npm` modules to this repository will unlink anything linked by `npm link`.)
